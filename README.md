Visual C# Game Programming for Teens
====================================

[![Book Cover for Visual C# Game Programming for Teens](https://github.com/remi/csharp-game-programming-for-teens/raw/master/assets/book-cover.jpg)][book]

I picked up [this book][book] to play around with simple 2D game programming.

It's "For Teens" but it has good content for getting started with game programming, before diving into more advanced game programming books.

Just playing!
