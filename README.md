Visual C# Game Programming for Teens
====================================

[![Book Cover for Visual C# Game Programming for Teens](https://github.com/remi/csharp-game-programming-for-teens/raw/master/assets/book-cover.jpg)][book]

I picked [this book][book] up just to play around with simple 2D game programming.

It's "For Teens" but it has good content for getting started with game programming, before diving into more advanced game programming books.

Playing with this book's exercises (code found here - review commit log for earlier exercises).
